# Podcast Prioritizer
Welcome to our wonderful app! The purpose of Podcast Prioritizer is to suggest podcasts for the user based on their commute time. 

There are 4 steps to this app:
- Step 1: Enter your location and destination
- Step 2: Choose a travel method (walking or biking)
- Step 3: Search for a podcast of choice by name, genre or topic. If you cannot decide, you can also select the random option to be given a random podcast topic.
- Step 4: Podcast results are generated based on travel time, and the user can listen to one of their choice.
